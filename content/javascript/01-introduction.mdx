# Introduction to JavaScript

Welcome to your first lesson in JavaScript! In this lesson, you'll learn the
fundamentals of JavaScript and write your first program.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the
core technologies of the World Wide Web. It enables interactive web pages and is
an essential part of web applications.

<Callout type='info' title='Did you know?'>
   JavaScript was created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995!
</Callout>

## Your First JavaScript Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```javascript
// This is a comment
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript has several basic data types:

### Numbers

```javascript
let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;
```

### Strings

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let message = "Hello, JavaScript!";
```

### Booleans

```javascript
let isActive = true;
let isComplete = false;
```

### Arrays

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

<Callout type='warning' title='Variable Naming'>
   Variable names in JavaScript are case-sensitive and cannot start with a
   number.
</Callout>

## Basic Operations

You can perform various operations with these data types:

```javascript
// Arithmetic operations
let sum = 10 + 5;
let difference = 10 - 5;
let product = 10 * 5;
let quotient = 10 / 5;

// String concatenation
let greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

// Array operations
colors.push("yellow"); // Add to end
let firstColor = colors[0]; // Access first element
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
   return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Call the function
let message = greet("Alice");
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## Practice Exercise

Try creating a simple calculator function:

<CodeTabs defaultValue="exercise">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="exercise">Exercise</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="solution">Solution</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  
  <TabsContent value="exercise">
    ```javascript
    // Create a function that adds two numbers
    function add(a, b) {
        // Your code here
    }

    // Test your function
    console.log(add(5, 3)); // Should output: 8
    ```

  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="solution">
    ```javascript
    function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
    ```

  </TabsContent>
</CodeTabs>

## What's Next?

In the next lesson, we'll explore:

- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Objects and methods
- Event handling

<Callout type='success' title='Congratulations!'>
   You've completed your first JavaScript lesson! Keep practicing and you'll
   become proficient in no time.
